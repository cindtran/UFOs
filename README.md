# UFOs

## Overview ##

This project requires using Javascript and creating an HTML to determine the number of UFOs sightings. The analysis requires a table to visualize the filtered results.

## Results ##

Prior to the changes, the website only included one button to for users to filter. With the updated version, users can now enter additional filters and the table will populate the filtered information.

## Summary ##

One minor setback on the change would be the website would be to require less manual work for the user. Although, the newer version does offer more insights, the additional entering can cause users to lose interest in researching their finds.
Additional feedback on how to improve the site would be provide a user friendly nagavigation and provide visuals of filtered results such as graphs.
